          Navbars are responsive meta components that serve as navigation headers for your application or site. They begin
           collapsed (and are toggleable) in mobile views and become horizontal as the available viewport width increases.
           Justified navbar nav links are currently not supported.Overflowing contentSince Bootstrap doesn't know how much
           space the content in your navbar needs, you might run into issues with content wrapping into a second row. To resolve this, you can:
          Reduce the amount or width of navbar items.
          Hide certain navbar items at certain screen sizes using responsive utility classes.
          Change the point at which your navbar switches between collapsed and horizontal mode. Customize the @grid-float-breakpoint variable or add your own media query.
          Requires JavaScript plugin.If JavaScript is disabled and the viewport is narrow enough that the navbar collapses, it will be impossible to expand the navbar and
           view the content within the .navbar-collapse.The responsive navbar requires the collapse plugin to be included in your version of Bootstrap.
           Changing the collapsed mobile navbar breakpoint.The navbar collapses into its vertical mobile view when the viewport is narrower than @grid-float-breakpoint, and
           expands into its horizontal non-mobile view when the viewport is at least @grid-float-breakpoint in width. Adjust this variable in the Less source to control when
           the navbar collapses/expands. The default value is 768px (the smallest "small" or "tablet" screen).Make navbars accessible
          Be sure to use a nav element or, if using a more generic element such as a div, add a role="navigation" to every navbar to explicitly identify it as a landmark region
          for users of assistive technologies.
